A beautiful syntax theme that helps focus on the important and avoids being distracted by multitudes of styles and (signal) colors.

## Principles

### Minimal highlighting, just 5 classes:

1. Strings
2. All statically known constants (numbers, keywords, boolean, etc)
3. Global definitions
4. Standard language keywords (def, if, else, etc)
5. Comments

### Comments highlighting

Comments are clearly visible - unlike in many other syntax themes! I think if there are comments we should see and read them first.

### Readability / contrast

For good readability text has contrast 6:1 and it is consistent for all colors. Contrast calculated with [HCL color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space). Secondary color contrast is 2.5:1

## Supported languages

## Install

- Happy coding! :heart:

### Thanks

Forked from the (inactive) [Chestnut Light Atom](https://github.com/biletskyy/chestnut-light-atom-syntax) syntax theme by [Dmitry Biletskyy](https://github.com/biletskyy).

Thanks also to [Ferdinand Vogler](https://github.com/fv0) for the excellent [native-ui UI theme](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui) that plays exceptionally well with this syntax theme.
